# Axiom Init

Initializes an Axiom project. `axiom-init` should be run from `create-axiom-client` and not directly.

## Introduction

Axiom allows developers to compute over the history of Ethereum in their smart contracts by utilizing the power of Zero Knowledge proofs. Access more data at a lower cost on-chain, made trustless by the power of ZK. Use transactions, receipts, and historic state in your smart contract.
