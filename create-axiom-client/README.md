## Introduction

Axiom allows developers to compute over the history of Ethereum in their smart contracts by utilizing the power of Zero Knowledge proofs. Access more data at a lower cost on-chain, made trustless by the power of ZK. Use transactions, receipts, and historic state in your smart contract.
